    <p>Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results or longer if you have time.</p>
    <p>I invented this wonderful marinated, grilled flank steak recipe and my friends and girls just love it.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps to make:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade until thoroughly combined. Place steak in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
    <li>Pour marinade over flank steak in the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
    <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
