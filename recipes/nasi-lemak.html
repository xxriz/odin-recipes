<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nasi lemak is delicious Malaysian coconut rice, drizzled with an anchovy and hot chile sauce, then topped with fried</p>
    <p>anchovies, fried peanuts, sliced cucumber, and hard-boiled egg.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups coconut milk</li>
    <li>2 cups long grain rice, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>1 whole bay leaf</li>
    <li>Â¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps to make:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Make the rice: Stir coconut milk, water, rice, fresh ginger, ground ginger, bay leaf, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf and keep rice warm until garnish and sauce are ready.</li>
    <li>While the rice is cooking, make the garnish: Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly browned. Remove peanuts with a slotted spoon and place onto paper towels to soak up excess grease.</li>
    <li>Return the skillet to the stove. Stir in anchovies and cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil and wipe out the skillet.</li>
    <li>Make the sauce: Heat oil in the clean skillet. Stir in onion, shallots, and garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in chile paste and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; if mixture is too dry, add water as needed. Stir in anchovies and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt; simmer until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Ladle warm rice into bowls. Top with warm sauce, then top with peanuts, fried anchovies, hard-boiled eggs, and cucumber.</li>
