<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ayam penyet is a fried chicken dish consisting of fried chicken that is squeezed with the pestle against the mortar to make it softer, and is served with sambal, slices of cucumbers, fried tofu, and tempeh ( mostly cucumber)</p>
    <p>Ayam penyet is known for its spicy sambal, which is made with a mixture of chilli, anchovies, tomatoes, shallots, garlic, shrimp paste, tamarind and lime juice.</p>
    <p>Like its namesake, the sambal mixture is then smashed into a paste to be eaten with the dish.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled, divided</li>
    <li>3 shallots, divided</li>
    <li>1 ½ inch piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1 ½ inch piece galangal, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
